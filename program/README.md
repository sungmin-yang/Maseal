## GNU General Public License(GPL)
The GPL grants and guarantees a wide range of rights to developers who work on open-source projects.<br/>
Basically, it allows users to legally copy, distribute and modify software. <br/>

you must give them a copy of the GNU GPL, which basically tells them that they could probably get the software elsewhere for free.<br/>


## GNU Lesser General Public License(LGPL)
The word "Lesser" in the title shows that the LGPL does not guarantee the end user's complete freedom in the use of software<br/>
it only guarantees the freedom of modification for components licensed under the LGPL, but not for any proprietary components.<br/>


## BSD License
 BSD licenses represent a family of permissive free software licenses that have fewer restrictions on distribution compared to<br/>
 other free software licenses such as the GNU General Public License.<br/>
 
 
## MIT License
 The MIT License is the least restrictive license out there. It basically says that anyone can do whatever they want with the licensed material,<br/> 
 as long as it’s accompanied by the license.<br/>
 
 You can give the software away for free or sell it. You have no restrictions on how to distribute it.<br/>
The only restriction is that it be accompanied by the license agreement.<br/>
