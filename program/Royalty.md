The source code is available under Apache 2.0 which freely allows commercial usage, modification (without reciprocity),<br/>
distribution, etc.

## Answer
1. The OS it self is free, but most large OEMs get more than that. Google charges extra for their app such as maps, gmail, etc. 
2. From interent sources average cost per device for Android OS could reach 60$ and the reason are payments to companies like MS,<br/>
Oracle, RIM.. for patents which Android OS uses
